        <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at <em>anything</em> at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall</em> and <em>fail</em> and <em>fall</em>.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer</strong> making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You <em>just</em> don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole <strong>universe</strong><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <em> one thing</em>:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.
